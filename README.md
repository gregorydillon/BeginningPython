Noisebrige Beginning Python Class

I forked this from Kellan class, because I want to be able to work from two different, or more laptops.

When I tried clone to my laptop, then send it back up to github.   And the HTTP rejected/failed.  It seemed that 
github wanted me to have Kellan password,, rather than mine
